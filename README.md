# EmoMagnet

EmoMagnet is a music recommendation system that leverages emotion detection to recommend songs based on the user's current emotional state. It utilizes TensorFlow for emotion detection and transfer learning techniques to adapt pre-trained models for song recommendation.

## Overview

EmoMagnet analyzes the user's emotions in real-time using a TensorFlow-based emotion detection model. It then utilizes transfer learning to adapt the pre-trained model to predict the user's emotional state. Based on the detected emotion, EmoMagnet recommends songs that are most suitable for the user's current emotional state.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Utilizes TensorFlow for real-time emotion detection from user inputs.
  
- **Transfer Learning for Emotion Prediction**: Adapts pre-trained models using transfer learning techniques to predict the user's emotional state.
  
- **Collaborative Filtering for Song Recommendation**: Implements collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend songs based on the user's emotional state and preferences.

## How it Works

1. **Emotion Detection**: EmoMagnet captures user inputs (e.g., text, speech, facial expressions) and processes them using the TensorFlow-based emotion detection model to determine the user's emotional state.

2. **Transfer Learning**: The pre-trained emotion detection model is fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques to adapt it for predicting the user's emotional state.

3. **Song Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotional state and user preferences, EmoMagnet employs collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend songs that align with the user's current emotional state and musical taste.
